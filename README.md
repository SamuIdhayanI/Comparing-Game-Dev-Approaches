# 'FROM CODE TO CLICK' : A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF GAME DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES

This project conducts a detailed comparative analysis of two divergent game development methodologies: the programming-centric approach using Pygame, a traditional library for game development, and CORE, a modern game platform that emphasizes visual development and user-friendliness. The study aims to dissect and evaluate the developmental processes, user experience, flexibility, and the resultant game quality and performance of these methodologies.

### Project Goals:
- Compare the development processes, user experience, flexibility, and game quality of Pygame and CORE.
- Develop a prototype game using both methodologies to facilitate direct comparison.
- Evaluate based on quantitative measures (development duration, code quantity, performance metrics) and qualitative assessments (learning curve, user experience, creative expression).
- Explore each tool's ecosystem including documentation, community support, and educational materials.


### Methodologies:
#### Pygame

  Pygame is a library used for game development in Python, offering granular control and benefiting from Python's capabilities but requiring more time investment in coding and architecture.

#### CORE

  CORE is a modern game platform providing a more intuitive logic system and ready-to-use assets, accelerating game creation but potentially limiting detailed customization.
